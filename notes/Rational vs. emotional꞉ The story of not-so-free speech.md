# Rational vs. emotional: The story of not-so-free speech
We live in the 21st century. We have ready access to all the world's knowledne we could ever imagine – we can discuss with people from across the world and fact check our opinions and beliefs in minutes. The idea of an inter-connected world sounds very appealing. However, it can backfire in an unpleasant, unexpected way. 

This recipe for disaster has two main ingredients: revenue-optimised algorithms on social media, and a natural human desire for attention.

In order to exist, social media companies have to make money. They do so by showing ads to their users. The more time a user spends on the platform, the more sponsored content they see and this of course generates more revenue for the company. Consequently, the user has to be presented with content that's as engaging as possible.

Numerous studies have shown that polarising or otherwise controversial content generates more user engagement – such posts are usually prioritised by the algorithm. Content also has to adhere to users' opinions – this can lead to a so-called Dunning-Kruger effect, when a user of a social media platform feels validated in their beliefs by other posts on their timeline – redardless of how close to the objective truth they are.

Now, let's combine it with attention seeking, and the "woke" culture.

"Being woke" could be defined as "being pretentious about how much you care about a social issue (e.g. racism, poverty or general inequality among people) without the need to be qualified enough to comment on it". Some people can thus easily use social media as an echo-chamber to amplify their opinion and gain massive attention.

I think this has gone too far. For anything you say or do, there will be someone who will disagree. The amplification of controversial topics has led to a new era of "democratic censorship" – where public actors must specifically avoid controversial topics. This ruins our creativity and, most importantly, our freedom of speech. 

I believe that any kind of freedom is precious. And we should look after it and never let go of it.
